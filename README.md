## Introduction


This is our rendition of the game Battleship first created by Clifford von Wickler.

Battleship is a two-player tactical guessing game. Each player's fleet of warships is marked on regulated grids, which are used to play the game. The other player is not aware of the enemy fleets' positions. Players try to destroy their enemy's fleet. Our game takes place on Island Icky. Players will play against AI.
